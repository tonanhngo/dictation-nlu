Reason for consultation is atrial fibrillation.

History of present illness patient's history is obtained from the medical records {period} Patient is a 91-year-old gentleman, who was admitted for pulmonary rehab and respiratory therapy {period} Patient was recently treated with pneumonia {period} The patient has a cardiac history of chronic atrial fibrillation status post cardiac cardiopulmonary arrest {period} The patient also has chronic systolic congestive heart failure, ejection fraction about 45% {period} Patient has pacemaker {period} Cardiology consultation was requested {period} Patent is not on anticoagulation due to recurrent anemia and the patient has been treated medically with rate controlling medications {period}

Past medical history one ventilatory-dependent respiratory failure, status post tracheostomy. Number two pneumonia. Number three chronic systolic congestive heart failure. Next number chronic atrial fibrillation. Next number status post pacemaker. Next number acute on chronic kidney disease. Next number chronic anemia.

Allergies no known drug allergies {period}

Medications includes furosemide, Protonix, atorvastatin, acetylcysteine, albuterol, Atrovent.

Social history the patient does not smoke or drink {period}

Family history noncontributory.

Review of systems unable to obtain from the patient {period}

Physical examination General a well-developed, well-nourished, gentleman, lying in bed, no acute distress. Temperature is 97.6, heart rate 80, respirations 22, blood pressure 104/57, pulse ox 98%. HEENT normocephalic, atraumatic. Anicteric sclerae. Neck is supple {period} Tracheostomy is in place {period} Lungs coarse breath sounds bilaterally {period} Diminished at the bases {period} Cardiovascular irregularly irregular {period} Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended {period} Extremities:  2+ ankle edema bilaterally {period}

Laboratory data white count is 24, hemoglobin 8.4, hematocrit 23.9, platelet count is 263. Sodium 140, potassium 4.0, chloride 98, bicarbonate 28. BUN 124, creatinine 2.41, glucose 134. Telemetry shows atrial flutter with controlled ventricular rate {period}

Assessment and recommendations number one atrial fibrillation. Patient currently appears to be in atrial flutter with rate controlled {period} Again, no anticoagulation due to recurrent anemia, requiring blood transfusion {period} We will continue to monitor {period} Continue current medications {period} Number two acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure. The patient has fluid retention probably due to combination of renal insufficiency, as well as decreased systolic function {period} The patient then started on low-dose diuretic {period} Continue to monitor renal function {period} Fall restriction as tolerated {period} Next number hypertension, currently controlled {period} Next number cardiac pacemaker. Pacemaker in place {period} Currently not requiring any pacing {period}

Thank you very much the physician for allowing me to consult on your patient {period}
