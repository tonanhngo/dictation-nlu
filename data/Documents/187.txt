Identification 45-year-old Caucasian male with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, stage IV synovial sarcoma, recent diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus, now with C2 fracture and complete C1 through C4 quadriplegia with de facto ventilator-dependent respiratory failure through the rest of his life, status post right upper lobe pneumonia, status post hyponatremia, sick euthyroid syndrome and the patient is now with two decubitus ulcers one stage IV and one stage III with questionable osteomyelitis. Subjective patient is sleeping. Objective vitals blood pressure 105/58, ranging yesterday 95 to 131/50 to 71, heart rate of 94, ranging yesterday 71 to 104; temperature 96.8, T-max 99.4, respiratory rate of 20, ranging yesterday 20 to 26. In general this is a fit-appearing Caucasian male with a tracheostomy, on a vent, sleeping, no apparent distress. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, clicks or rubs. Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended. Good bowel sounds. No masses. Extremities no clubbing, cyanosis or edema. Glucose levels starting yesterday morning 157, 139, 127, 189, 147. This morning 109 and 167. No labs today but it should be noted the patient is starting on oxandrolone. Assessment and plan excellent glycemic control on Levemir 10 units q.h.s. We will continue this. The patient is starting on oxandrolone per the plastic surgery team who is working at his wound. A study showed that apparently there is a 10 to 20 fasting healing rate on androgen. This is a direct androgen therapy. I obviously believe risk outweigh the benefits but of course long-term androgen therapy results can result in gonadal suppression. The patient could be potentially dependent on androgen long term. We will have to see what the status is and how long it has continued. We will monitor the administration of this medication.
