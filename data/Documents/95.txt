The patient is seen today on rounds. She complains of some tremor of the hand. She is followed by Neurology. I have offered her to have an appointment with her neurologist try to help decide for further treatment. She denies any chest pain. She denies any chills or sweats. She does have reflux. There is some discussion about whether she might be able to tolerate Prilosec versus the Protonix that has been ordered. She is not currently on Plavix. Review of systems otherwise negative. Physical exam vital signs blood pressure 118/64, pulse 80, respirations 15. HEENT no JVD noted. Heart regular rate and rhythm. Lungs no wheezes or rhonchi are noted. Abdomen is soft, nondistended, nontender with positive bowel sounds x4. Extremities no edema, clubbing or cyanosis of the extremities noted. Skin no rashes noted. Assessment number one CVA. Next number hyperlipidemia. Next number hypertension. Next number GERD. Next number history of recurrent urinary tract infection. Plan continue aspirin. It would be okay to change proton pump inhibitor if need be. Continue long-term care. Follow up with Neurology for treatment of tremor. If she does not want to do so, would certainly consider stopping Reglan as I feel this is probably adding to her tremor. If tremor continues to be bad, will stop completely. The physician ending this dictation.
