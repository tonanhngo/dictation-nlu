Preop diagnosis is right knee medial meniscal tear. Postop diagnosis same with addition of patellar chondromalacia, synovitis. Operative procedure was number one right knee arthroscopy. Number two partial medial meniscectomy. Number three chondroplasty of the patella. Surgeon the physician and staff anesthesia with general anesthesia. Operative procedure in supine position placed under general anesthesia. No tourniquet was used or placed. Leg was prepped with triple prep and draped in standard fashion. Standard anterolateral and anteromedial portal were established. Diagnostic arthroplasty revealed the patella had a lateral condylar flap {period} And medial condylar flap {period} And little crack of cartilage in the trochlear groove and then inflammatory tissue over the lateral aspect of the femoral condyle {period} Scope [skip] scope was place in the medial compartment of the knee {period} The condylar surface intact. The medial meniscus had a posterior horn tear which was complex and a partial medial meniscectomy was performed with arthroscopic biter, shaver smoothed with monopolar system. Scope was placed in the intercondylar notch. ACL graft was intact but there was significant fraying of the anterior third of it {period} Which was trimmed with arthroscopic shaver {period} Scope was [skip] lateral compartment of the knee, lateral condylar surface was intact as was the lateral meniscus. Scope was placed in the suprapatellar pouch and a chondroplasty of the patella of two patellar flaps was performed medially and laterally and then removed the inflammatory tissue along the medial femoral condyle which was causing erythema on the medial aspect like the medial trochlea medial femoral condyle area {period} The area was widely irrigated drained 30 mL of 8% Marcaine 5 mg of Duramorph placed intraarticularly. Portals were closed with 4-0 Prolene stitch end dictation.
