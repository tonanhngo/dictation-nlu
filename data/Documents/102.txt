The patient is seen today on rounds. She has a recent x-ray with question which shows a compression fracture question age. Patient has thought thinks that she has a previous compression fracture in the area. New advent of pain may indicate new fracture though. She has had a decrease to pain medication over time secondary to sedating effects. This may need to be readjusted given her new issues. Patient remains on Norco and Lyrica. She wishes to see if increase in pain medication could help. Review of systems otherwise negative. Physical examination vital signs blood pressure 152/80, pulse 61, respirations 15.
