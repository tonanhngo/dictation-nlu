Reason for consultation is cardiomyopathy and bradycardia.

History of present illness patient's history is obtained from the medical records as well as the patient {period} However, the patient herself is somewhat of a poor historian {period} Nevertheless, the patient is a 74-year-old pleasant woman, who is known to me from previous hospitalization, admitted to Hospital name for pulmonary rehab and respiratory therapy {period} The patient has a history of cardiomyopathy, ejection fraction about 20% to 30% {period} The patient also has a history of cardiac arrest {period} The patient upon arrival was noted to have an abnormal EKG {period} The preliminary EKG reading was atrial fibrillation, but upon further examination and review of the EKG, I believe it is mostly artifact at the baseline {period} Review of the telemetry strips shows that the patient has episode of sinus rhythm with frequent premature ventricular contractions and an episode of sinus bradycardia {period} The patient herself does not report any symptoms {period} Currently, the patient is in no distress {period}

Past medical history number one cardiomyopathy. Number two history of old myocardial infarction. Number three dilated cardiomyopathy. Next number hypercapnic hypoxemic respiratory failure. Next number pulmonary fibrosis. Next number chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with pulmonary hypertension. Next number diabetes mellitus. Next number chronic anemia. Next number seizure disorder. Next number hypertension. Next number fibromyalgia. Next number history of Addison's disease. Next number gastroesophageal reflux disease. Next number pressure ulcers.

Allergies penicillin.

Review of systems per history of present illness; otherwise unremarkable.

Physical examination general, well-developed, well-nourished woman, lying in bed, in no acute distress {period} Temperature 97.6, heart rate is 100, blood pressure 150/70, pulse ox 99%. HEENT normocephalic, atraumatic. Anicteric sclerae. Neck is supple {period} no excuse me possible JVD {period} Lungs diminished breath sounds with coarse crackles bilaterally {period} Cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm. No sorry 1/6 systolic murmur {period} Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended {period} Extremities no peripheral edema {period}

Laboratory data white count 4.9, hemoglobin 8.9, hematocrit 26, platelet count is 163. Sodium 141, potassium 4.0, chloride 82, bicarb is 53, BUN of 35, creatinine 0.32, glucose is 34. This was all done on October 19th, 2016. Again, the EKG shows sinus rhythm, septal Q waves, lot of baseline artifact {period}

Assessment recommendations number one abnormal EKG, most likely due to artifact {period} Patient does not have atrial fibrillation at this time {period} We will continue to monitor {period} Number two bradycardia. Patient has episode of sinus bradycardia {period} This may possibly be vagal induced {period} Currently in sinus rhythm with a normal rate {period} We will continue to monitor on telemetry {period} No indication for pacemaker at this time {period} Next number dilated cardiomyopathy. Patient is compensated {period} Continue with carvedilol and aspirin {period} We will consider adding ACE inhibitor or ARB depending upon patient's blood pressure {period} Next number history of myocardial infarction. Patient is on aspirin and beta-blocker {period}
