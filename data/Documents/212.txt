Reason for consultation is a coronary artery disease and pacemaker.

History of present illness the patient is an 82-year-old Filipino woman who unfortunately has history of coronary artery disease, status post previous coronary bypass surgery and was admitted to Hospital name after suffering cardiac arrest {period} The patient was resuscitated but is currently on the ventilator {period} Patient was transferred to Hospital name for pulmonary rehab and respiratory therapy {period} The patient also has a history of cardiac pacemaker {period} On the x-ray, the ventricular lead was noted to be in a inferior position [skip] abnormal position and there was concern about pacemaker lead placement and thus Cardiology consultation was requested {period} Currently, the patient again is intubated and somewhat confused, unable to provide any further history {period}

Past medical history number one coronary artery disease, status post coronary bypass surgery. Number two old myocardial infarction. Number three previous stroke. Next number bilateral carotid disease. Next number cardiac arrest and status post excessive resuscitation. Next number hypertension. Next number hyperlipidemia. Next number diabetes mellitus. Next number sepsis. Next number acute renal insufficiency. Next medtronic dual chamber permanent pacemaker.

Allergies no known drug allergies {period}

Medications includes valsartan, insulin, Haldol, aspirin, amiodarone, enoxaparin, Atrovent, metoprolol, Protonix, atorvastatin.

Social history the patient does not smoke or drink {period}

Family history no family history of early heart disease {period}

Review of systems per history of present illness, otherwise unremarkable {period}

Physical examination general well-developed, well-nourished woman, lying in bed, intubated, mildly agitated {period} Temperature is 98.2, heart rate 79, respirations 22, blood pressure 141/64, pulse ox 99%.

INR is 1.0. EKG shows ventricular paced rhythm {period} Chest x-ray shows normal cardiac silhouette {period} Sternotomy wires are present {period} Dual chamber permanent pacemaker is present {period} Atrial lead appears to be appropriately positioned {period} The right ventricular lead is downward pointing and appears to be below the diaphragm {period} 

Assessment recommendations number one coronary artery disease. Patient is on appropriate aspirin and statin. Number two old myocardial infarction. Patient is on appropriate aspirin and beta-blocker {period} Number three pacemaker in situ. We will have the pacemaker interrogated {period} Patient is pacing on the telemetry {period} The pacemaker lead still may be in the right ventricle and just there is overlap of the diaphragm dome with the right ventricle {period} Next number hypertension, currently controlled {period} Next number hyperlipidemia. Continue statin. Next number
