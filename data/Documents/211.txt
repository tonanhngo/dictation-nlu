The indication for this study is rule out endocarditis and tricuspid regurgitation.

Procedure performed 2-D echocardiogram with Doppler and color flow imaging {period} The quality of the study is technically difficult due to poor imaging windows {period}

The measurements intraventricular septum is 0.8 cm, left ventricular posterior wall is 0.8 cm, left atrial diameter is 3.0 cm, aortic diameter is 2.5 cm, left ventricular end diastole is 4.4 cm and systole is 3.0 cm.

The findings left ventricle is of normal size and systolic function {period} Estimated ejection fraction is 60% {period} Next number the right ventricle, right atrium and left atrium normal in appearance {period} Next pericardium is normal without any significant effusion {period} Next number mitral valve was normal in appearance {period} No significant stenosis or regurgitation {period} Next aortic valve is normal {period} No significant stenosis or regurgitation {period} Next tricuspid valve demonstrates mild regurgitation {period} Next number catheter noted in the right atrium {period} Next number no intracardiac thrombus, vegetations, or masses seen {period} Next number technically difficult study due to poor imaging windows {period} 

Conclusions number one technically difficult study due to poor imaging windows {period} Number two preserved preserved left ventricular systolic function {period} Number three mild tricuspid regurgitation {period} Next number no intracardiac thrombus, vegetations, or masses seen {period}
