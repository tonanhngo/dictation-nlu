The patient is seen today on rounds. She is seen in follow up. Her cough has improved. Her breathing has improved. She continues to participate on dialysis. I have approved the orders to increase medications aimed at phosphorus issues as directed by dietary from her dialysis clinic. She continues to have itching. She requests oral Benadryl, unfortunately when she took oral Benadryl, she had a quite a bit of issues with sedation. I have cautioned her about such and asked that dietary changes to be made to try to help with the issues that she has. She has been non-compliant with her diet in the recent past. Review of systems otherwise negative. Physical examination vital signs blood pressure 125/87, pulse 80, and respirations 17. HEENT no JVD noted. Heart regular rate and rhythm. Lungs no wheezes or rhonchi are noted. Abdomen is soft, nondistended, and nontender with positive bowel sounds x4. Extremities no edema, or clubbing or cyanosis of the extremities noted. Skin no rashes noted. Assessment number one make that pulmonary infection. Next number diffuse pruritus. Next number end-stage renal disease, on dialysis. Next number noncompliance. Plan complete oral antibiotics. Continue medications aimed at pruritus. Would avoid oral Benadryl, as it made her quite drowsy in the past. Discussed with the patient today, encouraged compliance.
