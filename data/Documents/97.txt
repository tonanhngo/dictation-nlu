The patient is seen today on rounds. She seems somewhat more drowsy than usual. Staff says that she has been drowsy of late. She has seen some mild wheezing and is using her nebulizer medication. She has some lower extremity edema. Noncompliance does limit treatment of her diabetes and her swelling. I have discussed with her today need to probably back off on dosing of MS Contin to try to help with drowsiness. She seems amenable. We will start Tylenol No. 3 as a breakthrough pain medication.
