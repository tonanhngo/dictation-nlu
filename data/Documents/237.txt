Reason for consultation atrial fibrillation.

History of present illness  patient's history is obtained from the medical records {period} Patient is minimally interactive {period} The patient is a 91-year-old gentleman with a history of dementia who was admitted to Hospital name with pneumonia {period} Patient has developed anasarca {period} Patient has acute on chronic kidney failure as well as acute on chronic diastolic heart failure {period} The patient also has a known history of coronary artery disease as well as paroxysmal atrial fibrillation {period} Patient has developed recurrent atrial fibrillation and thus Cardiology consultation was requested {period} 

Past medical history number one chronic diastolic heart failure. Number two paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Number three recent pneumonia. Next number Alzheimer's dementia. Next number coronary artery disease, status post prior coronary angioplasty. Next number hypertension. Next number old stroke. Next number acute on chronic kidney failure.

Allergies penicillin, coconut, peanuts, and benzodiazepines have caused worsening encephalopathy.

Social history patient quit smoking, drinking years ago {period}

Family history is noncontributory for early heart disease {period}

Review of systems unable to obtain from the patient {period}

Physical examination general a well-developed, well-nourished gentleman lying in bed, in no acute distress {period} Temperature 97.2, heart rate is 57, respirations is 20, blood pressure 103/50, pulse ox 100%. HEENT normocephalic, atraumatic. Anicteric sclerae. Neck tracheostomy is in place {period} No JVD {period} Lungs coarse breath sounds bilaterally with diffuse crackles {period} Cardiovascular irregularly irregular {period} Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended {period} Extremities 2 to 3+ edema in the hands and feet bilaterally {period}

Laboratory data white count is 14, hemoglobin 9, hematocrit 26, platelet count is 72. Sodium 143, potassium 4.6, chloride of 108, bicarbonate is 26, BUN of 155, creatinine is 2.87, glucose 164. EKG on admission shows sinus rhythm with frequent PVCs. Current telemetry shows atrial fibrillation with frequent PVCs {period}

Current medications includes levothyroxine, Epogen, meropenem, metolazone, furosemide, Reglan, insulin, digoxin, Flagyl, Albuterol, Atrovent, atorvastatin, folic acid.

Assessment and plan number one paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Patient is currently back in atrial fibrillation {period} The patient is rate controlled {period} The patient was previously on Xarelto but this has been held due to the patient's anemia requiring blood transfusion {period} Patient also has thrombocytopenia {period} Continue to hold anticoagulation at this time. {period} I will also hold aspirin due to the pancytopenia {period} Number two coronary artery disease. Patient has a history of previous angioplasty {period} Again, we will have to hold aspirin and antiplatelet therapy due to anemia {period} Number three acute on chronic diastolic heart failure. The patient has fluid retention due to a combination of kidney disease as well as heart failure {period} Patient also most likely has a decreased oncotic pressure from poor nutrition {period} I am sorry decreased oncotic pressure from decreased protein {period} The patient is being considered for dialysis for fluid removal since the patient is not responding to IV diuretics {period} We will continue to monitor {period} Continue ventilator support {period} Next number hypertension, currently controlled {period}
