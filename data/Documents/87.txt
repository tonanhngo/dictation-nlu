_________is seen today on rounds. I was called earlier today to state that he had an MBS which is recommended NPO status. I did meet with family today and have asked them to decide for whether they would like to proceed with PEG tube placement or to sign a waiver. The patient appears comfortable during my exam. Later approximately an hour later, he would show signs and symptoms of respiratory distress and would be sent to the emergency room. The patient had denied shortness of breath prior. Physical exam vital signs blood pressure 120/81, pulse 75, respirations 20. HEENT  no JVD noted. Heart irregularly regular. Lungs no wheezes or rhonchi are noted. Abdomen soft, nondistended, nontender with positive bowel sounds x4. Extremities trace edema noted pretibially. Skin no rashes noted. Assessment number one dysphagia with recommendation for NPO status. Next number Parkinsonism. Next number pulmonary embolism, on Coumadin. Next number hypertension. Next number atrial fibrillation. Next number bipolar disorder. Next number GERD. Plan the patientâ€™s decompensation is not allowed. Further discussion of PEG tube placement. He will need evaluation in the ER with hopeful admission and possible PEG tube placement there. He is of course had increased risk of periprocedure risk given his recent pulmonary MI I am sorry given his recent pulmonary embolism. Physician ending this dictation.
