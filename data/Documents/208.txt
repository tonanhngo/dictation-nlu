HPI this is a 29-years-old, G1 who is now a G1, P1-0-0-1, who was presented from the office to the L and D at 38 plus six for complaints for induction of labor. Her prenatal blood pressure had been normal and on her last day of office visit her blood pressure was 132 {slash} 82 and the physician mentioned that she has hypertension during pregnancy and advised induction or observation, and patient opted for induction and she presented to L and D.

She was induced with the Cervidil and once the Cervidil was removed after 12 hours her dilation was 10 cm and eventually she received an epidural and progressed, and had a spontaneous vaginal delivery of a male infant.

Her two day postpartum was uneventful and she was eventually discharged on on day number two to follow up at the office in approximately five to six weeks. Thank you so much.
