She denies any abdominal pain. She still has her gallbladder. She denies any diarrhea. She does say she has been mildly constipated and that the nausea began with some constipation. She denies chills or sweats. She denies dysuria. Review of systems otherwise negative. Physical exam vital signs blood pressure 125/64, pulse 80, respirations 20. HEENT no JVD noted. Heart regular rate and rhythm. Lungs no wheezes or rhonchi are noted. There is prolonged expiratory phase. Abdomen is soft, nondistended, nontender with positive bowel sounds times four. Extremities no edema or clubbing or cyanosis of the extremities are noted. Skin no rashes noted. Most recent urinalysis showed no evidence of UTI. This was approximately a week and a half old. Assessment number one recurrent nausea questionable etiology. Next number recent constipation. Next number COPD. Next number history of urinary tract infection with most recent urinalysis being relatively negative. Plan I suspect that Bactrim which she is receiving may be contributing to her nausea. It should end soon. She has already had some seven days of treatment, would stop such at this time. Would order Zofran as needed, would add PPI for the time being. If nausea does not resolve will need imaging, CMP, etc. She has no abdominal pain at this time. We would also add Metamucil or make that also add we would also add MiraLax to help with bowel movements.
