This will limit further imaging possibility. She may benefit by evaluation by orthopedics, this would probably the next step. She is already on pain medications to include Norco. She is on baclofen for spasm. She remains on strike she remains on. We will give a trial of Neurontin today to see if this helps her pain may benefit from addition of NSAID in the future as well. Orthopedics evaluation again will be explored if these conservative measures do not help her.
