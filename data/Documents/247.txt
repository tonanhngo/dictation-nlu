Type of study diagnostic polysomnogram.

Clinical history The Patient is a 72-year-old male who was previously diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea, but had difficulty tolerating CPAP therapy {period} He returns to the I’m sorry he returned to the sleep clinic for a repeat assessment on Month DD, YYYY, at which time, he reported ongoing symptoms from untreated sleep apnea {period} He was therefore recommended to undergo a repeat evaluation {period}

Current medications include bumetanide {comma} potassium chloride {comma} Lopid {comma} Ranitidine {comma} bupropion {comma} aspirin {comma} etodolac {comma} multivitamin {comma} vitamin B12 {period} He uses Efudex e f u d e x as needed and triamcinolone acetonide.

Recording montage the study was recorded on Easy III Cadwell amplifier that is compliant with current American anatomy of Sleep Medicine standards {period} The patient underwent digital polysomnography with simultaneous recording of electroencephalogram {comma} electrooculogram {comma} electromyogram {comma} electrocardiogram {comma} oral and nasal air flow with combined oral and nasal thermosensor {comma} nasal air pressure transducer {comma} pulse oximetry {comma} leg movement {comma} body position {comma} sound {comma} and video {period} The data was adequate for interpretation and was reviewed in its entirety {period}

Sleep scoring followed the standards put forth by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine {period} Hypopnea rule roman numeral eight {dot} four {dot} b was used {period}

Sleep architecture lights out initiated at 11:27 p.m., lights on at 5:35 a.m. {period} Sleep efficiency was 58% {period} Increased wake after sleep onset was noted {period} Wake after sleep onset duration was 42.8% {period} Sleep onset latency is 11 minutes and REM onset latency was 84.5 minutes {period}

Stage N1 was noted at 52 minutes I’m sorry delete that sentence so far stage N1 was noted at 24% {comma} stage N2 was noted at 52% {comma} N3 was 0%, and stage REM was 24%.

Respiratory analysis, occasional hypopneas were noted during this assessment associated with 3 to 4% oxygen desaturations and {slash} or critical arousals {period} AASM apnea hypopnea index is 15.5 events an hour {period} CMS apnea/hypopnea index is 6.2 events per hour {period}

Oxygen desaturations to a nadir 88% were noted {period} Mean oxygen saturation were noted at 95% {period}

Events were noted in the supine position as well as in the left lateral position {period}

ECG normal sinus rhythm was noted with occasional premature atrial contractions {period} Mean heart rate was 74 beats per minute {period} Minimum heart rate of 57 beats per minute was noted {period}

EEG This limited EEG montage does not show any significant abnormalities {period}

PLMs I’m sorry periodic limb movements limb movement index of 122 events was noted {period} Limb movements associated with cortical arousal was 5.4 {period}

EMG excessive phasic elevations were noted during REM stage and EMG tone in the arm and lower extremity leads {period} In addition, leg movements were also noted on the video during REM stage {period} This lack of REM atonia is suggestive of I’m sorry delete that. This is suggestive lack of REM atonia {period}

Impression number one obstructive I’m sorry delete that impression. Primary diagnoses number one obstructive sleep apnea space 327.23. Next line periodic limb movement disorder space 327.51.

Impression this diagnostic polysomnogram shows evidence of obstructive sleep apnea obstructive sleep apnea {period} Respiratory events comprised of hypopnea associated with 3 to 4% oxygen desaturations noted in the supine and left lateral positions {period} Supine REM was not observed during this assessment {period} Increased wake after sleep onset was noted {period}  Frequent limb movements were noted, which resulted in a mildly elevated cortical arousal index {period} Lack of REM atonia was also observed {period}

Recommendations due to the patient's prior Intolerance to PAP therapy, it is recommended that the patient pursue a titration study in the lab. During the upcoming titration, we would also have an opportunity to assess further limb movements to see if they would improve after instituting PAP treatment {period}  Next line no driving or operating heavy machinery in the presence of drowsiness symptoms.

Thank you for referring this patient to the Hospital Name, Sleep Disorder Center {period} Should you have further questions or concerns regarding his care, please feel free to contact me.
