The indication for this study is mitral valve disease and rule out endocarditis. 

Procedure performed 2-D echocardiogram with Doppler and color flow image {period} The quality of the study is technically difficult due to poor imaging windows {period}

Dimensions interventricular septum is 1.0 cm, left ventricular posterior wall is 0.7 cm, left ventricle end diastole is 4.9 cm; end systole is 3.4 cm, aortic valve is 3.7 cm, left atrial diameter is 4.8 cm.

Findings left ventricle is normal size and systolic function. Estimated ejection fraction is 55% {period} Next number the right ventricle and right atrium are normal in appearance {period} Left atrium was mildly enlarged {period} Next the pericardium is normal without any significant effusion {period} Next number the mitral valve is thickened and calcified {period} Unable to visualize well {period} No significant gradient across the mitral valve I am sorry there is a mild gradient across the mitral valve {period} Unable to excuse me there is mild mitral regurgitation {period} Unable to rule out vegetation {period} Next number aortic valve was also thickened and sclerotic {period} Mild aortic regurgitation {period} Next is tricuspid valve demonstrates mild regurgitation {period} Next number no pleural effusion {period}

Conclusion number one technically difficult study due to poor imaging windows {period} Number two thickened and calcified mitral valve with mild mitral stenosis and mild mitral regurgitation {period} Unable to rule out vegetation, but no obvious mass is seen {period} Next number mild aortic and tricuspid regurgitation {period}

End dictation thank you.
