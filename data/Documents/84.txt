The patient is seen today on rounds. He has passed his dental extraction. He had significant back pain this weekend and was evaluated in the ER for such. It largely resolved and he has re-presented back to the hospital. In his words, he thinks he had a pinched nerve. There apparently was a very specific spot on his back that was causing significant pain and was not alleviated by current pain medication agents. He remains on Lovenox in treatment of a make that for anticoagulation in as a bridge after dental extraction. I have discussed possibility of furtherance of pain management treatment with injection, etc. This will need to be discussed with the physician upon his return. Review of systems otherwise negative.
