The patient is seen today on rounds. He is seen in a therapy gym. He appears comfortable. He denies new complaints. He does state that his 24-hour urine collection was an incomplete or was an unusable sample due to labeling issues. He also states that he has had recent bilateral knee MRI, but does not know the results. I assume the results and sent to his orthopedist. He denies any further complaints. Review of systems is otherwise negative. Physical exam vital signs blood pressure pulse 85, respirations 15, recent weight 253. HEENT no JVD noted. Heart regular rate and rhythm. Lungs no wheezes or rhonchi are noted. Abdomen is soft, obese, nondistended, nontender. Extremities no edema or clubbing or cyanosis of extremities is appreciated. He has bilateral knee immobilizers on. Skin no rashes noted. Neuro no focal deficit noted. Assessment number one status post bilateral patellar tendon rupture, status post repair by the physician, recent MRI done. Next number make that recent MRIs done. Next number history of vasovagal syncope. Next number possible adrenal mass as seen on CT. Next number history of hydrocele. He is followed up with the physician. Next number obesity. Next number debility. I would like to add lab most recent labs, sodium 137, potassium 4.0, chloride 102, bicarbonate 28, glucose 162, BUN 12, creatinine 0.95. Plan request CT results of the knees, also need to obtain CT results of the of the abdomen and pelvis, which showed possible adrenal mass. If I would said CT results of the knees I should have states this MRI of the knees. Continue therapy for now. Monitor blood pressure.
