  "complications none spasms on blood loss minimal occasions the patient is a forty two year old male with chronic right shoulder pain and weakness after failure of nonoperative treatment after thirty station with the patient regarding the risks and benefits %HESITATION ",
  "of %HESITATION %HESITATION arts Copic surgery wished to proceed procedure patient was placed just excess induction of general anesthesia with regional block patient place in a beach chair position on the operating table the right shoulder and right upper extremity was prepped and draped free in the usual sterile fashion the paragraph thirty degree arthroscope was introduced into the right shoulder joint via standard posterior portal pump inflow was used with the arthroscope cannula gravity outflow was established via an accessory anterior portal ",
  "status lineament joint was examined the articular cartilage of the humeral head and the glenoid was in excellent condition there was extensive synovitis present Shaver was brought in and thorough anterior synovectomy was performed the past it was marked tearing of the biceps tendon with longitudinal splitting and fraying of the tendon %HESITATION period %HESITATION this %HESITATION %HESITATION there what the subscapularis tendon was intact the supraspinatus tendon however had been avulsed ",
  "off of the anterior %HESITATION greater %HESITATION tuberosity %HESITATION period there was some partial thickness tearing of the infraspinatus tendon this was thoroughly debrided at all loose unstable tissue was removed ",
  "the path is extensive tearing of the superior labrum which was debrided at the anterior inferior labrum was intact %HESITATION period verifying debridement synovectomy anterior shoulder the arthroscope was placed anteriorly a poster synovectomy %HESITATION was performed a period ",
  "new paragraph the arthroscope was then placed in the subacromial space in accessory lateral portal there was a fairly thick subacromial bursitis a bursa was resected the subacromial periosteum was removed status fairly significant hooking to the acromion so an acromioplasty was performed with the Burr in the posterior portal about eight to ten millimeters of bone was removed anteriorly confirmation of a smooth flat acromioplasty was made with the arthroscope in the lateral post your portal hypertension was trying to the AC joint which was quite arthritic and remaining soft tissues off the end of the clavicle were removed we then resected approximately one centimeter of distal clavicle with the Burr care was taken to protect the superior acromioclavicular soft tissues confirmation of complete distal claviculectomy ",
  "was made with the arthroscope in all portals the pair of any remaining bony and soft tissue debris was removed attention was turned to the rotator cuff we confirmed an avulsion of the supraspinatus %HESITATION tendon with about does one two centimeters retraction after mobilizing this this was %HESITATION more of an L. shaped %HESITATION tear up period I was able to bring it back to its normal anatomic %HESITATION attachment without undue tension the pair of the greater tuberosity was gently abraded appeared at triple armed suture anchor was placed in the anterior portion of the supraspinatus tendon and a second triple armed anchor was placed more posteriorly a period ",
  "using a variety of suture passing techniques the nonabsorbable sutures were woven through the biceps tendon and to the anterior limb of the supraspinatus tendon ",
  "we sutured down the anterior lateral corner of the rotator cuff with normal anatomic position %HESITATION we then passed multiple sutures through the avulsed rotator cuff for a medial row repair additional sutures were placed %HESITATION laterally a period that we then sequentially tied down the sutures %HESITATION very nice stable and anatomic %HESITATION repair of the rotator cuff tendon to the greater tuberosity was obtained %HESITATION period ",
  "additional sutures were placed to the biceps tendon for the tenodesis %HESITATION to pass the arthroscope was placed back in the glenohumeral joint we confirmed a very nice repair of the rotator cuff the biceps tendon was tenotomized the intra articular portion was resected appeared to pass the shoulder was again examined No other pathology was noted the incidence removed from the shoulder the portals were closed with interrupted sutures one for well for today with Marcaine covered dry sterile dressing ",
